However, the analysis of extensive datasets from these platforms can be daunting without the right tools. This project was initiated to streamline this process, offering a thorough and visually appealing method to monitor performance metrics, including:  
- Average impressions: 89K  
- Average engagement rate: 0.04  
- Total tweets analyzed: 1,166  
- Engagement breakdown by media type and interactions.  
The dashboard empowers organizations to concentrate on data-driven decisions that enhance engagement and visibility.

## Learning Objectives 
- Grasp data integration and management using Power BI with Twitter data sources.  
- Acquire skills in developing interactive dashboards featuring dynamic filtering options.  
- Analyze engagement metrics such as impressions, retweets, and URL clicks to extract actionable insights.  
- Understand the daily impact of Twitter data based on retweets, engagement rates, likes, and media views.  
- Master advanced data visualization techniques to present complex data in an accessible format.  

## Activities and Tasks 
- Data Integration: Imported Twitter data, including metrics like impressions, engagements, retweets, and URL clicks.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Ensured consistency and removed null data for accurate analysis.
- Dashboard Development: Designed visuals such as bar graphs, line graph For these task :
1. "Top Engagement rate by tweet " that include multiple filteration and this visuals helped understand temporal patterns.
2. "Top 10 Tweets by sum of retweets and likes " it identified high-performing content by retweets and likes.
3. "Average engagement rate for each month with media content and without media content " it identified the trend of the avg engagement rate.
